They are here to serve as an <a href="__Oren Epstein_Resume _10_2018.pdf">online resume</a> for those who wish to consider me for <span class="greenies">employment</span> and others who just wish to view my portfolio. Please navigate to my projects by clicking the tiles below.

	<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">This site is the 4th iteration of oren-epstein.com. As the times have changed and I've moved from project to project, I've learned new skills, and when I have down time between projects, I like to refresh my website. The first site was a simple wordpress install (no longer in existence), the next time it was KohanaPHP, <a href="http://www.oepstein.a2hosted.com/oren-epstein/">visit the older version!</a>, this time, its entirley in <span class="greenies">Vue.JS</span> sitting on top of the <span class="greenies">Laravel Framework</span>, and using <span class="greenies">MySQL</span> for a back end. In my free time, I also like to learn new tech, so look for more versions of this site coming soon to a browser near you.</p>
